# Crystal Collector

## About
This application is a fun and interactive game for web browsers! The app dynamically updates the HTML pages with **jQuery**. 

The game begins with a randomly generated number shown in the scoreboard. Below the scoreboard are four (4) crystals.

Each crystal is given a random value at the beginning of each round. The user's goal is to attempt to reach the randomized total given by the game by clicking each crystal and watching as their personal point-score increments. If the user's score overshoots the game's total, the user loses that round and the game begins again. If the user is able to match the exact total of the game's score, they win the game!
